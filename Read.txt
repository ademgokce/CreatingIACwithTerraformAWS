The Terraform script orchestrates the deployment of a robust AWS infrastructure for hosting web applications. It begins by establishing a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a defined CIDR block and sets up an Internet Gateway to enable external connectivity. A Route Table is configured to direct traffic both IPv4 and IPv6 to the Internet Gateway. Within this VPC, a subnet is created in a specific availability zone, associated with the Route Table for proper routing. Security is managed through a Security Group allowing inbound SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) traffic. A Network Interface is allocated with a static private IP and tied to the Security Group. An Elastic IP is assigned to the Network Interface, ensuring a persistent public IP address for the associated EC2 instance. IAM roles and policies are defined to grant EC2 instances access to specific S3 resources, facilitating secure data management. Finally, an EC2 instance is provisioned with the specified AMI, instance type, and user data script that installs and configures Apache web server, syncing content from an S3 bucket to host a web application. Additionally, a VPC Endpoint for S3 is created to enable private access to S3 services within the VPC, ensuring secure data transfer.
